<!-- Difference between HTML tags and elements -->
The  difference between html tags and elements is that an element is a set of opening and closing tags.
 While tags are just labels that you use to mark up the beginning and end of the element.

EX: <p>Paragraph Tag</p>
<!-- In the above example <p> is a tag where as paragraph is a element enclosed btw the tags -->
   
Explain br tags

The <br> tag in HTML document is used to create a line break in a text.
It is generally used in poem or address where the division of line is necessary. It is an empty tag, which means it does not need a company of end tag.

EX:That cannot fly. <br>  
   
Hold fast to dreams <br>  

<!-- Explain how many different types of lists we have in html  -->
There are three different types of lists in HTML.
1.Ordered List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default:

2.An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with small square boxes by default:

3.Description List

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term

    <!-- What are semantics tags? -->

    The HTML semantics refers to the tags that provide meaning to an HTML page rather than just presentation. 
    It makes HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages.   
    
     Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
     Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

        <!-- Write code to create an ordered list with roman numbers -->
        <ol type="I">
       <li>Apple</li>
       <li>Orange</li>
       <li>Banana</li>
       
        </ol>

        <!-- Write code to create an unordered list with circle     -->

        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Orange</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
        </ul>
